## About

I forked this repo to learn how to make language extensions for VS Code.

## Credits

Forked from [hardy-ethan's vscode-scheme](https://github.com/hardy-ethan/vscode-scheme) (which is a fork from the [original by tinyjiahao](https://github.com/tinyjiahao/vscode-scheme)).

This extension uses [a file from egrachev's sublime-scheme](https://github.com/egrachev/sublime-scheme/blob/master/Scheme.tmLanguage) to enable syntax on vscode.

**Enjoy!**
